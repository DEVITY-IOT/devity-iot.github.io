# Next Steps

## Reset and level devices

Many sensors can maintain themselves. 
Nevertheless, it makes sense to reset and recalibrate the devices at certain intervals. 
Jobs are perfect for this because, on the one hand, the schedule can be used very easily. 
On the other hand, jobs are very scalable by assigning them to device groups. 
KEYNOA takes care of the scalable onboarding, Azure jobs take care of the recalibrations. 


## Trigger actions based on a schedule

IoT sensors can be used for a variety of tasks. Typically, the sensors provide data on which actions and decisions are carried out. 
For example, if the stock level needs to be measured, this can be done via IoT sensors. 
Measurements can be done via push or pull. 
If the stock level has to be measured every morning, it can make sense to only transmit the stock level on request in the morning in order to save bandwidth and energy. 
Jobs are perfect for this, to trigger actions that have to be executed according to a schedule.


## Update properties for better administration

IoT sensors have a number of properties that they manage themselves. 
For example, the installation date, maintenance date or operating hours can be stored in a cloud platform to have a better overview of the sensors' status. 
If attributes like these are updated regularly, jobs can be helpful. 
At specified times, attributes are updated via jobs and thus ensure better administration of all sensors used.
