# Next Steps

## Monitor the entire factory

KEYNOA creates device profiles, which in turn respond to the Thingsboard Rule Engine. 
This enables a scalable provisioning of thousands of IoT devices. 
Each device is tagged with attributes during setup and KEYNOA does the rest. 
This way, every square metre of a warehouse can be controlled with temperature rules. 


## Trigger actions based on defined conditions

IoT devices are much more versatile than just temperature and telemetry data. 
For example, existing level indicators of storage slots can be connected with the KEYNOA Test Kit device. 
If the sensor data is processed in the cloud, the Thingsboard Rule Engine can be used to perform certain actions when the level falls below a defined minimum. 
For instance, a warning can be sent to the responsible department or a new order can be placed automatically.

## Send emails when complex event occurs and use metadata

IoT devices can monitor a wide range of complex events in conjunction with the Thingsboard Rule Engine.
The actions that are performed when an event is triggered are equally versatile.
However, if you simply want to reach people, a standard method provided by Thingsboard is to send an email including the event properties.
In this way, an IoT monitoring process can be easily integrated into the organisation's existing workflow.
