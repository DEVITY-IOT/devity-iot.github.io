# About Thingsboard

## What is Thingsboard

ThingsBoard is an open-source IoT platform for data collection, processing, visualization, and device management. It supports cloud and on-premises deployments, and it combines scalability, fault-tolerance and performances to nullify the chances of getting your IoT data lost.

The integration between KEYNOA and ThingsBoard is an example of an MQTT integration. ThingsBoard embeds an MQTT Broker, which is configured with the ThingsBoard Integrations functionality to subscribe or publish data.

You can find more detailed information about features and the pricing model of Thingsboard [here](https://thingsboard.io/pricing/).

## Thingsboard Rule Engine

The Thingsboard Rule Engine is an easy to use framework for building event-based workflows. There are 3 main components:

1. Message - any incoming event. It can be an incoming data point from devices, device life-cycle event, REST API event, RPC request, etc.
2. Rule Node - a function that is executed on an incoming message. There are many different Node types that can filter, transform or execute some action on incoming Messages.
3. Rule Chain - nodes are connected with each other with relations, so the outbound message from rule node is sent to next connected rule nodes.

## Use Cases

Thingsboard Rule Engine is a highly customizable framework for complex event processing. Here are some common use cases that one can configure via Thingsboard Rule Chains:

- Data validation and modification for incoming telemetry or attributes before saving to the database.
- Copy telemetry or attributes from devices to related assets so you can aggregate telemetry. For example data from multiple devices can be aggregated in related asset.
- Create/Update/Clear alarms based on defined conditions.
- Trigger actions based on device life-cycle events. For example, create alerts if a device is Online/Offline.
- Load additional data required for processing. For example, load temperature threshold value for a device that is defined in deviceâ€™s customer or tenant attribute.
- Trigger REST API calls to external systems.
- Send emails when complex event occurs and use attributes of other entities inside email template.
- Take into account user preferences during event processing.
- Make RPC calls based on defined condition.
- Integrate with external pipelines like Kafka, Spark, AWS services, etc.
