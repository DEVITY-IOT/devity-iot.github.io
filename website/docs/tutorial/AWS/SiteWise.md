# AWS Setup


## Initial Situation
In your research as a marine biologist, you have the task to investigate the influence of climate change on the development of different fish cultures. To do this, you have placed different types of fish in a total of 100 water tanks, which are now exposed to different conditions. The most important parameter for the development of the fish cultures is the temperature. Therefore, you need a solution to collect the temperature data and display it graphically over time. You also want to display the values on your cell phone in real time.
