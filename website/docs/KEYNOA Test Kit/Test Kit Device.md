In cooperation with our partner [Janz Tec](https://www.janztec.com/en/) we developed a Test Kit with a pre-installed KEYNOA SDK.

## emPC-A/RPI3+
Janz Tecâ€˜s emPC-A/RPI3+ is a device which uses an original Raspberry Pi 3 model B+ module inside. This module is mounted on a self-developed mainboard providing a 24 V power supply, a CAN inter face, a real-time clock, digital inputs and outputs and an additional RS232/RS485 interface.

### Scope of delivery
- emPC-A/RPI3+ with standard Raspbian Operating System
