# Execution

In this part you will compelte the onboarding process and run the example usecase of an MQTT client.

## Onboarding

Navigate our terminal inside the unpacked download package.
Execute the *linux-client* binary and the onboarding process will be completed.

Put visual guidence here as well.

## MQTT client

Now that you have completed the onboarding process you can run the MQTT client.
Start the MQTT client by executing the *mqtt_client*.
Note: You can supply a string as a command line argument to the MQTT client to change the message it sends.
On the website (I need to figure out a place to represent the mqtt msg) you can now see the message you provided to the MQTT client.
The MQTT client establishes the connection via TLS that way without the onboarding process authentication would not be possible.
