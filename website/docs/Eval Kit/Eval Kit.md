The KEYNOA Eval Kit is a unique opportunity to boost your knowledge about how to build up flexible, scalable, and secure IoT use cases.

## What you will learn
- Simple and secure device connectivity with freedom of choice between AWS, Azure, and Thingsboard cloud platforms.
- Intuitive data visualization and rule chain definition for your IoT use case.
- Differences in pricing models and feature sets of the provided clouds.

## Tutorial structure
- First, you link KEYNOA to a data plattform or cloud.
- Then, you define how and which devices will establish a secure connection via MQTT or OPC UA.
- When you power on the device, KEYNOA will onboard your device to ThingsBoard, Azure IoT Central or AWS IoT Core.
- After that, your device will send telemetry data to the cloud.
- The last step in each tutorial is to define your own rules and create your own dashboard to visualize the data in the cloud.

## Grow your skills
- Explore the tutorials and use-cases.
- Understand the architecture.
- Learn the advantages and usability of each IoT cloud.
