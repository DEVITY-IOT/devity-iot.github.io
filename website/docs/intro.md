Find out about what KEYNOA will able to be to do in the future:

to orchestrate end-to-end encryption, mutual authentication, key management, credential management, and authorization policy enforcement – at massive scale.

The Device Managment Cloud is easiest and quickest way to add your IIoT Devices.
You can add your IIoT Devices to major Cloud Service such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and many more.
This is your central place to manage all IoT-enabled devices, even in multi-provider setups.
Firmware updates with new functionality or security patches can be rolled outfrom here as well.
This documentation gives you in-depth details on how to use the Device Management Cloud and even how to setup all Cloud Services.
It also shows you how to add devices in three different ways. Receieve and send data to the devices to and from the cloud services.
You can also setup your own MQTT Broker and receieve or send data to devices.

KEYNOA empowers you to:

- Build a encrypted connection to various clouds.
- Create end-to-end encrypted, authenticated secure channels.
- Generate unique cryptographically provable Identities and store private keys in safe Vaults. Add-ons for hardware or cloud key management systems.
- Operate project specific and scalable Credential Authorities to issue lightweight, short-lived, easy to revoke, attribute-based credentials.
- Onboard fleets of self-sovereign application identities using Secure Enrollment Protocols to issue credentials to application clients and services.
- Rotate and revoke keys and credentials – at scale, across fleets.
