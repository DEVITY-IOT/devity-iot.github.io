# KEYNOA

KEYNOA is a software to securely connect smart devices to any cloud or on-premises data platform on massive scale in industrial use cases. 

It consists of two components: KEYONA SDK and KEYNOA Enrollment Service.
- KEYNOA SDK is a software client for device manufacturer. It is responsible for issuing a unique identity to every device produced.
- KEYNOA Enrollment Service is a web application. It is responsible for transferring device identities, configuring and onboarding groups of devices and managing devices during the life cycle. 

KEYNOA empowers you to:

- Add devices to various SCADA systems, on-premises data platforms, and IoT clouds such as AWS, Azure, and many more.
- Onboard fleets using secure enrollment protocols to issue applications and services to devices.
- Identifiy, authenticate and autorize devices with unique identities as required in IEC 62443. 
- Create end-to-end encrypted, authenticated und trustworthy communication channels.
- Generate unique provable identities and store private keys in safe vaults (internal/ external hardware or cloud key management systems).
- Operate project specific and scalable Certificate Authorities to issue short-lived, easy to revoke certificates (x.509).
- Centrally, manage all IoT-enabled devices in a vendor independent tool.
- Rotate and revoke keys and credentials – at scale, across fleets.
- Protect devices and data from unauthorized access with a build in user and access management system.
- Roll out updates with new functionality or security patches.

You will find more information about KEYNOA on our [website](https://devity.eu/keynoa/).

# KEYNOA Eval Kit 

The KEYNOA Eval Kit is desgined for users that want to get a first idea on how to use IoT clouds to process data. It gives you the opportunity to get a feeling of how easy it is to onboard a device to three different clouds and building your own IoT use cases from scratch by sending real-time data. You will learn how to use AWS, Azure and Thingsboard clouds to visualize data and defining rules for your own IoT application. Moreover, you gain an impression of how you can use KEYNOA to build your own scalable IoT product or provide your customers the flexible and secure connection technology they need. You can also setup your own MQTT Broker and receieve or send data to devices.

The KEYNOA Eval Kit consists of an Industrial Embedded Controller (based on Raspberry Pi 3+) from our partner [Janz Tec](https://www.janztec.com/en/) with a pre-installed KEYNOA SDK. [Here](https://www.janztec.com/sicherheit-im-maschinenbau/) you can order a Eval Kit.  

The documentation guides you step-by-step through the whole process from device preparation to cloud connection till data visulization. You can start the tutorials with our KEYNOA Eval Kit here (//Link einfügen).

### How to get a KEYNOA Eval Kit
If you haven not tried KEYNOA yet, you can order a device from our partner JanzTec and test KEYNOA for 30 days [here](https://www.janztec.com/sicherheit-im-maschinenbau/).
