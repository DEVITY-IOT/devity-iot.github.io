# About AWS IoT

## What is AWS IoT
AWS IoT provides the cloud services that connect your IoT devices to other devices and AWS cloud services. AWS IoT provides device software that can help you integrate your IoT devices into AWS IoT-based solutions. If your devices can connect to AWS IoT, AWS IoT can connect them to the cloud services that AWS provides.

## Subscription Limitations

The AWS subscription used with the KEYNOA Test Kit is limited in its usage. As this Test Kit is not designed to be used in productive environment we will forward excessive costs generated to you.
To circumvent this, we encourage you to not let the device run unsupervised or for more than an hour.
Find the subscription limitations and a cost table in [Cloud Subscription Limits section.](/Eval%20Kit#subscription%20limits)
