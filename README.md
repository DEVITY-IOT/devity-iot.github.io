# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Local Development

```
$ npx docusaurus start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

We are using GitHub pages for hosting, GitHub actions are used to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch from where it is deployed.
